      For anyone to understand how I got to live in Spain, it's necessary a tiny bit of information about the previous chapters of my life. I was just a regular Peruvian guy trying to get a bachelor's degree in Psychology. This normality crashed and burnt when, for reasons I still ignore, my family went through a huge economic crisis, so I, Diego (or "D"), had to indefinitely pause my university studies. Another requirement for my family to survive this situation was that I had to get a boring 60-hour-per-week job with a minimum wage.</p>

      So you'll probably understand how this big sudden change in D's life would cause mental stress on him. So after a couple of years, I wasn't able to mentally cope anymore and thought I needed a major change in my life. Desperate and tired of it all, I grabbed the little savings I had and got on a plane to the furthest place I could think of, which at the time was Europe, and went ahead without any certain idea of what I'd find there. But confident that whatever it was that I would find would feel like a relief. Landing in Spain and getting to know a new city was as exciting as I expected but the worst would come after.</p>

      At the start, I did make some friends, whom I met while wandering around the city or at hostels, but eventually they all left and carried on with their travelling plans. So in the end I felt pretty much alone and with less and less money every day. This is until my sister messaged me saying that I had an uncle living in Madrid and wanted to contact me and help me orientate a bit. It all ended in a 10-minute phone call where the only helpful thing out of it was that there were some cousins of mine, whom I'd never met before, living in Barcelona for about 10 years. Also, these Catalan cousins had expressed that they were eager to meet me before I moved elsewhere. So I did! And they happened to be really nice people. </p>

    <p>
      They allowed me to stay at their house for a couple of weeks and also gave me some advice in case I would decide to stay in Barcelona for a longer period. My cousin told me something I hadn't noticed at all and it was that she was pregnant! So given the situation, she said they would eventually need the room where I was staying for the baby. But at the same time said they would help me with anything I needed while I couldn't decide exactly what to do. During one of the dinners, we had together the idea of volunteering for accommodation came up, which sounded super interesting. </p>

      This is how my journey in Spain went on, I found some volunteering programs in a few Catalonian towns and tried them all for several months. In exchange for only a few hours a day of my helping out I got a bed in my own room or in a shared one, some times I even slept in a caravan or a tent out in the woods! As adventurous as that sounds you'd eventually get fed up with all the farm chores, babysitting and living so far from the civilization. </p>

      Luckily, after staying with a Catalan family in Tarragona for a couple of months and taking care of their kid and their orchard, I found a new more exciting volunteering spot at a hostel in Barcelona. This was way more up my alley, my tasks there were different and many but super fun as well. From sitting at the reception desk and checking-in new guests and taking payments and preparing dinner for everyone, to taking the tourists out for a walk to the main city attractions during the day or to the trendiest clubs at night. You can't imagine the number of interesting people from all over the world I got to meet here. Made a bunch of friends, some of whom I still see and talk to nowadays. And among these new acquaintances, there was a special girl who sooner than later would become my girlfriend.  </p>

      I honestly wasn't interested in starting a relationship back then at all, but things happened between us so spontaneously and smoothly that I don't think any of us realized at the time what was really going on. Anyway, she'd always had the idea of moving in permanently to a city like Barcelona and I was still clueless about what to do, so we decided to rent a flat for some months and move in together to see what came out of it. We spent almost a year living together and having lots of fun. Given that she was an engineer, I got from her my first contact with web designing and software developing. We travelled, we partied, we cooked together, everything seemed perfect.

        Our families thought we were close to getting married and having kids. Ha! But that wasn't in our plans, we just wanted to live our lives and have fun. That was until Covid appeared and brought along economic distress for us who were already struggling to make ends meet. Well, I guess nothing gold can stay, as they say. After this marvellous time as a couple, we decided it was better for each of us to separately return to our countries of origin. That easier for her since she was European and only had a half-hour flight to take. I, on the other hand, found it a lot harder. The pandemic had hit South America way harder, so much that there was no way for me to get back there. Thus I got sort of stuck in Spain, on my own one more time.</p>

        Everything got more difficult due to the virus. Businesses were closing and volunteering programs got shutdown. This is when my sister, who is a doctor working in Peru, started worrying about me and my future and said she'd help me with some money until I figured out what to do. Since I didn't have a job nor anything else important to do. I started teaching English to immigrant teenagers taken under the wing of a non-profit organization located downtown Barcelona. Not much after this, It came to me that I could maybe teach actual paying students.

    <p>
          Didn't know why I hadn't thought of this before but as soon as I posted some ads online I got a lot of Spanish people interested in taking lessons from me. To this day that's my main income source but it's not a stable job, students come and go, I can't pay taxes,... Recently though, an Italian friend, who I had met while working at a hostel and being aware of my situation, recommended me a web design course designed for immigrant people in Barcelona. I had always been great with PC's but people working in the industry had told me there was no way for me to get a job as a web/app designer without a university degree or an organization backing me. But this program offered it all, hence why I made this page. To prove them I could learn and put to use most of the things in the introductory course. Hopefully, it'll be of their liking and I can professionally grow with them way further.
